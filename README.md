# BlackWhite2Color

ðŸŽ¨ Black & White Image Colorizer (Streamlit App)
This project is a simple yet interactive Black & White Image Colorizer built using Streamlit, OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn's KMeans Clustering. The app allows users to upload a grayscale (B/W) image and add vibrant colors to it based on selected color clusters.




 Features
 
âœ… Upload any black and white image (JPG or PNG)

âœ… Choose the number of color clusters (2 to 8)

âœ… Select custom colors for each cluster using a color picker

âœ… Automatically colorize the image based on KMeans clustering

âœ… Preview the colorized image instantly

âœ… Download the colorized output as a PNG file
